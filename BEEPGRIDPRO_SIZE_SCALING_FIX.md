# BeepGridPro Size Scaling Fix

## Problem
When setting the size of BeepGridPro to (1, 1) in the designer or code, the actual size became (3971, 2466) - approximately 3971x larger. This was caused by automatic DPI scaling.

## Root Cause
1. **BaseControl** sets `AutoScaleMode = AutoScaleMode.Inherit` in its constructor (line 154)
2. This causes the control to inherit DPI scaling from its parent container
3. On high-DPI displays (e.g., 400% scaling), the size gets multiplied by the DPI scale factor
4. The ratio 3971:1 suggests a ~397% or ~400% DPI scaling was being applied

## Solution Applied
Added DPI and scaling prevention to **BeepGridPro** by:

### 1. Override SetBoundsCore (lines 104-113)
```csharp
protected override void SetBoundsCore(int x, int y, int width, int height, BoundsSpecified specified)
{
    // Pass through without any scaling - use exact values provided
    base.SetBoundsCore(x, y, width, height, specified);
}
```

### 2. Override ScaleControl (lines 118-123)
```csharp
protected override void ScaleControl(SizeF factor, BoundsSpecified specified)
{
    // Do nothing - prevent any automatic scaling
    // Size should remain exactly as developer specifies
}
```

### 3. Set AutoScaleMode to None in Constructor (line 414)
```csharp
public BeepGridPro():base()
{
    // Disable automatic scaling to prevent DPI-based size changes
    // Size should be exactly as set by the developer
    AutoScaleMode = AutoScaleMode.None;
    
    // ... rest of constructor
}
```

## Result
- BeepGridPro now respects the exact size values set by the developer
- No DPI scaling is applied to the control's bounds
- Location and Size properties work exactly as expected
- The control size will be (1, 1) if you set it to (1, 1), regardless of DPI settings

## Files Modified
- `TheTechIdea.Beep.Winform.Controls\GridX\BeepGridPro.cs`
  - Added DPI and Scaling Control region (lines 102-125)
  - Modified constructor to set AutoScaleMode.None (line 414)

## Notes
- The `UseDpiAwareRowHeights` property (line 409) is still available for internal row height calculations if needed
- This fix only prevents the control's overall size from being scaled
- Internal rendering can still use DPI-aware calculations if desired
- This ensures pixel-perfect control over grid positioning and sizing in forms

## Testing
After this fix:
1. Set BeepGridPro.Size = new Size(1, 1) → Actual size will be (1, 1)
2. Set BeepGridPro.Size = new Size(100, 50) → Actual size will be (100, 50)
3. No unexpected scaling based on system DPI settings
