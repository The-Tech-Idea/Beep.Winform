# BeepImage Designer Display Fix

## Issue
BeepImage control was appearing as a tiny icon/tool in the WinForms designer instead of displaying as a proper control with visible size.

## Root Cause
The control lacked:
1. Proper `DefaultSize` property override
2. Explicit `MinimumSize` setting in constructor
3. Unconditional size initialization

## Solution Applied

### Changes in `BeepImage.cs`:

1. **Removed conditional size check**: Removed the `if (Width <= 0 || Height <= 0)` check that prevented size from being set properly in designer

2. **Added explicit size initialization**: 
   ```csharp
   this.Size = new Size(100, 100);
   this.MinimumSize = new Size(16, 16);
   ```

3. **Added DefaultSize override**:
   ```csharp
   protected override Size DefaultSize
   {
       get { return new Size(100, 100); }
   }
   ```

## Result
- BeepImage now displays as a 100x100 control in the designer
- Minimum size prevents it from becoming too small (16x16 minimum)
- Follows standard WinForms control behavior
- Designer can properly render and size the control

## Testing
After rebuilding:
1. Open a form in designer
2. Drag BeepImage from toolbox
3. Control should appear as a 100x100 visible control (not a tiny icon)
4. Control should be resizable but not smaller than 16x16

## Related
- This follows the same pattern as other Beep controls (BeepLabel, BeepButton, etc.)
- Integrates with DPI scaling from BaseControl
