# BeepImage Designer Fix - Updated

## Issue
BeepImage control was appearing as a tiny icon/tool in the WinForms designer instead of displaying as a proper control with visible size.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Missing `DefaultSize` property override
2. Missing explicit `MinimumSize` in constructor
3. **Custom Designer attribute was interfering** with basic rendering

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Size Initialization in `BeepImage.cs` Constructor:
```csharp
this.Size = new Size(100, 100);
this.MinimumSize = new Size(16, 16);
```

### 2. Added DefaultSize Override:
```csharp
protected override Size DefaultSize
{
    get { return new Size(100, 100); }
}
```

### 3. Disabled Custom Designer (Key Fix):
```csharp
// Temporarily disable custom designer to use default Control designer
// [Designer("TheTechIdea.Beep.Winform.Controls.MDI.Designers.BeepImageDesigner, TheTechIdea.Beep.Winform.Controls.Design.Server")]
```

## Why This Fixes The Issue

The custom `BeepImageDesigner` was overriding default rendering behavior. By removing it:
- Windows Forms uses the default `ControlDesigner` from BaseControl
- The control renders normally with its defined size
- The designer shows the actual control visual representation instead of a placeholder icon

## Testing Steps
1. **Rebuild the solution** (Clean + Build)
2. **Close all designer windows**
3. **Restart Visual Studio** (important - designer cache needs to clear)
4. Open a form in designer
5. Drag BeepImage from toolbox
6. Should now appear as a 100Ã—100 visible control

## Notes
- The custom designer (`BeepImageDesigner`) provides smart tags/actions but was preventing proper visual rendering
- If you need the custom designer features later, the issue needs to be fixed in `BeepImageDesigner.cs` to properly inherit from BaseControl's designer or to not interfere with rendering
- For now, basic design-time experience is restored with standard resize handles and property grid

## Alternative Solution (If Custom Designer Needed)
If the custom designer features are required, update `BeepImageDesigner.cs` to properly inherit from the BaseControl designer or implement proper rendering overrides.
