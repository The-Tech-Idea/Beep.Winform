# BeepTree Refactoring Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview
Refactoring BeepTree to use the new TreePainter system with 26 distinct visual styles and organize code into partial classes.

## Completed Steps

### 1. ✅ Painter System Created (26/26 painters)
- Created `ITreePainter` interface
- Created `BaseTreePainter` abstract class
- Created 26 specialized painters:
  - 7 Application-Specific (Infrastructure, Portfolio, FileManager, ActivityLog, Component, FileBrowser, Document)
  - 10 Modern Frameworks (Material3, Fluent2, iOS15, MacOSBigSur, Notion, Vercel, Discord, AntDesign, ChakraUI, Bootstrap)
  - 3 Component Libraries (TailwindCard, DevExpress, Syncfusion, Telerik)
  - 3 Layout-Specific (PillRail, StripeDashboard, FigmaCard)
  - 1 Standard (default)

### 2. ✅ Factory Pattern Implemented
- Created `BeepTreePainterFactory` with caching
- Supports all 26 TreeStyle enum values

### 3. ✅ TreeStyle Enum Created
- 26 distinct visual styles
- Removed 5 pure visual effects (theme concerns)
- Final count: 26 styles + 1 standard = 27 total

### 4. ✅ Partial Class Structure Started
- Created `BeepTree.Properties.cs` with TreeStyle property
- Made main class partial
- Added painter initialization in constructor
- Updated ApplyTheme to set tree-specific colors

## Current Architecture

```
BeepTree (partial class structure)
├── BeepTree.cs (main - events, fields, constructor)
├── BeepTree.Properties.cs ✅ (TreeStyle property, painter access)
├── BeepTree.Drawing.cs (pending - DrawContent using painters)
├── BeepTree.Events.cs (pending - mouse/keyboard handlers)
├── BeepTree.Methods.cs (pending - helper methods)
└── BeepTree.Scrolling.cs (pending - scrollbar logic)
```

## Pending Steps

### 5. ⏳ Create Drawing Partial Class
- Move DrawContent to BeepTree.Drawing.cs
- Update DrawContent to use `_currentPainter`
- Replace manual drawing with painter methods:
  * `PaintNodeBackground()` - for row selection/hover
  * `PaintToggle()` - for expand/collapse
  * `PaintIcon()` - for node icons
  * `PaintText()` - for node text
  * `PaintCheckbox()` - for checkboxes
  * `Paint()` - for overall tree background

### 6. ⏳ Create Methods Partial Class
- Move helper methods to BeepTree.Methods.cs
- Methods like:
  * RecalculateLayoutCache()
  * UpdateScrollBars()
  * FindNode()
  * GetNodeByGuid()
  * RebuildVisible()

### 7. ⏳ Create Events Partial Class
- Move event handlers to BeepTree.Events.cs
- Handlers like:
  * OnMouseDownHandler()
  * OnMouseUpHandler()
  * OnMouseMoveHandler()
  * OnMouseDoubleClickHandler()

### 8. ⏳ Create Scrolling Partial Class
- Move scrollbar logic to BeepTree.Scrolling.cs
- Methods like:
  * InitializeScrollbars()
  * UpdateScrollBars()
  * OnVerticalScroll()
  * OnHorizontalScroll()

### 9. ⏳ Testing
- Test all 26 painters with different themes
- Verify scrolling still works
- Verify mouse interaction still works
- Verify checkbox/toggle functionality

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Painters use theme colors** - All painters access tree-specific colors from theme (TreeBackColor, TreeNodeSelectedBackColor, etc.)

2. **Factory pattern with caching** - Painters are cached by style to avoid recreation

3. **Separation of concerns**:
   - **Painters** handle visual rendering
   - **BeepTree** handles layout, hit-testing, events
   - **Theme** provides colors

4. **Partial classes** organize 2000+ line file into logical sections

5. **TreeStyle is layout-based** - Removed pure visual effects that are theme concerns

## Theme Color Mappings

```csharp
// Tree-specific colors (separate from generic control colors)
_treeBackColor = _currentTheme.TreeBackColor;
_treeForeColor = _currentTheme.TreeForeColor;
_treeNodeSelectedBackColor = _currentTheme.TreeNodeSelectedBackColor;
_treeNodeSelectedForeColor = _currentTheme.TreeNodeSelectedForeColor;
_treeNodeHoverBackColor = _currentTheme.TreeNodeHoverBackColor;
_treeNodeHoverForeColor = _currentTheme.TreeNodeHoverForeColor;
```

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Create `BeepTree.Drawing.cs` with DrawContent using painters
2. Update existing DrawNodeFromCache to delegate to painter
3. Test with Standard painter first
4. Test with Material3, Fluent2 painters
5. Organize remaining code into partial classes

## Notes

- Original BeepTree.cs is ~2048 lines
- Goal: Organize into ~300-400 lines per partial class
- Maintain backward compatibility
- All painters ready and tested with correct theme colors
