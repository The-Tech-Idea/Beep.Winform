# FilteredRangeDateTimePicker Functional Fixes

## Issues Reported
1. **Quick filters not working** - Filter buttons in sidebar not responding to clicks
2. **Reset Date button not working** - Reset button not clearing selection
3. **Time From and To not working** - Time inputs not functional

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Filter Label/Key Mismatch
**Problem**: Three different sets of filter labels/keys were not aligned:
- **Painter displayed**: `"Past Week", "Past Month", "Past 3 Months", "Past 6 Months", "Past Year", "Past Century"`
- **Layout defined**: `"Today", "Yesterday", "Last 7 Days", "Last 30 Days", "This Month", "Last Month"` 
- **Hit handler expected**: `"today", "yesterday", "last7days", "last30days", "thismonth", "lastmonth"`

**Result**: When user clicked a filter button, the key sent to HandleClick didn't match any case in the switch statement, so nothing happened.

### 2. Incomplete Filter Support
**Problem**: HandleClick only supported 6 basic filters (today, yesterday, last 7/30 days, this/last month), but the painter was displaying different options including "Past 3 Months", "Past 6 Months", "Past Year", and "Past Century".

**Result**: Even if the keys matched, 4 of the 6 buttons would fail because their cases weren't in the switch statement.

## Fixes Applied

### FilteredRangeDateTimePickerPainter.cs

#### 1. Added Filter Keys Array
**Location**: `PaintFilterSidebar()` method

**Before**:
```csharp
string[] filters = { "Past Week", "Past Month", "Past 3 Months", "Past 6 Months", "Past Year", "Past Century" };
```

**After**:
```csharp
string[] filters = { "Past Week", "Past Month", "Past 3 Months", "Past 6 Months", "Past Year", "Past Century" };
string[] filterKeys = { "last7days", "lastmonth", "past3months", "past6months", "pastyear", "pastcentury" };
```

**Purpose**: Align display labels with internal keys.

#### 2. Updated CalculateLayout Filter Labels
**Location**: `CalculateLayout()` method

**Before**:
```csharp
string[] filterLabels = { "Today", "Yesterday", "Last 7 Days", "Last 30 Days", "This Month", "Last Month" };
```

**After**:
```csharp
string[] filterLabels = { "Past Week", "Past Month", "Past 3 Months", "Past 6 Months", "Past Year", "Past Century" };
```

**Purpose**: Match the labels actually being painted.

### FilteredRangeDateTimePickerHitHandler.cs

#### 1. Updated HitTest Filter Keys
**Location**: `HitTest()` method, SECTION 1

**Before**:
```csharp
string[] filterKeys = { "today", "yesterday", "last7days", "last30days", "thismonth", "lastmonth" };
```

**After**:
```csharp
string[] filterKeys = { "pastweek", "pastmonth", "past3months", "past6months", "pastyear", "pastcentury" };
```

**Purpose**: Match the keys being passed to HandleClick.

#### 2. Expanded HandleClick Switch Cases
**Location**: `HandleClick()` method, FilterButton section

**Before**: Only 6 cases (today, yesterday, last7days, last30days, thismonth, lastmonth)

**After**: Added support for all displayed filters:
```csharp
case "last7days":
case "pastweek":
    start = DateTime.Today.AddDays(-7); 
    end = DateTime.Today; 
    break;
case "last30days":
case "lastmonth":
case "pastmonth":
    start = DateTime.Today.AddDays(-30); 
    end = DateTime.Today; 
    break;
case "past3months":
    start = DateTime.Today.AddMonths(-3); 
    end = DateTime.Today; 
    break;
case "past6months":
    start = DateTime.Today.AddMonths(-6); 
    end = DateTime.Today; 
    break;
case "pastyear":
    start = DateTime.Today.AddYears(-1); 
    end = DateTime.Today; 
    break;
case "pastcentury":
    start = DateTime.Today.AddYears(-100); 
    end = DateTime.Today; 
    break;
```

**Also added**: `.Replace(" ", "")` to key processing to handle spaces in filter text.

**Purpose**: Support all 6 filter buttons with proper date range calculations.

## How It Works Now

### Filter Button Flow
1. User clicks "Past Week" button in sidebar
2. HitTest returns `DateTimePickerHitArea.FilterButton` with `KeyValue = "pastweek"`
3. HandleClick receives hit result and enters FilterButton case
4. Key "pastweek" matches `case "pastweek"` (or falls through from "last7days")
5. Sets `_start = DateTime.Today.AddDays(-7)` and `_end = DateTime.Today`
6. Sets default times: `_startTime = 00:00:00`, `_endTime = 23:59:59`
7. Calls `SyncToControl(owner)` to update the control's properties
8. Returns `false` to keep picker open (user can see the selection)

### Reset Button Flow
1. User clicks "Reset Date" button
2. HitTest returns `DateTimePickerHitArea.ResetButton`
3. HandleClick calls `Reset()` method which sets all fields to null
4. Calls `SyncToControl(owner)` to clear the control's properties
5. Returns `false` to keep picker open

### Time Input Flow (Current Behavior)
1. User clicks From or To time input
2. HitTest returns `DateTimePickerHitArea.TimeInput` with `KeyValue = "from"` or `"to"`
3. HandleClick enters TimeInput case
4. **Current implementation**: Sets default times if null
   - From: `00:00:00`
   - To: `23:59:59`
5. Calls `SyncToControl(owner)` to update times
6. Returns `false` to keep picker open

**Note**: Full time picker dialog is TODO in code comments. Currently just sets default times.

### Show Results Button Flow
1. User clicks "Show Results" button
2. HitTest returns `DateTimePickerHitArea.ShowResultsButton`
3. HandleClick checks `IsSelectionComplete()` (requires start date, end date, start time, end time all set)
4. If complete: Calls `SyncToControl(owner)` and returns `true` (closes picker)
5. If incomplete: Returns `false` (keeps picker open)

## Filter Date Range Mapping

| Button Display | Key | Date Range |
|---------------|-----|------------|
| Past Week | `pastweek` | Today - 7 days ‚Üí Today |
| Past Month | `pastmonth` | Today - 30 days ‚Üí Today |
| Past 3 Months | `past3months` | Today - 3 months ‚Üí Today |
| Past 6 Months | `past6months` | Today - 6 months ‚Üí Today |
| Past Year | `pastyear` | Today - 1 year ‚Üí Today |
| Past Century | `pastcentury` | Today - 100 years ‚Üí Today |

## Default Time Values

All filter buttons set:
- **Start Time**: `00:00:00` (midnight)
- **End Time**: `23:59:59` (one second before midnight)

This ensures the range captures the full day from start to finish.

## Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
1. **Quick filters now working**: All 6 filter buttons properly set date ranges
2. **Reset Date now working**: Clears all selections and returns to initial state
3. **Time From/To partially working**: Sets default times (00:00:00 and 23:59:59)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
1. **Time Input**: Clicking time inputs only sets defaults, doesn't show interactive time picker
   - Code comment indicates this is TODO: "Show time picker dialog"
   - Full implementation would require a time picker popup control
2. **Manual time entry**: No keyboard entry for custom times
3. **No time validation**: Times are always set to defaults when filters are clicked

### üîß Future Enhancements
1. Implement `ShowTimePickerDialog()` for interactive time selection
2. Add keyboard input support for time fields
3. Add time validation (start time < end time)
4. Add time format customization (12-hour vs 24-hour)
5. Add visual feedback when filter is selected (highlight/checkmark)
6. Store selected filter key to persist visual selection state

## Testing Verification

### To Test Quick Filters
1. Open FilteredRange mode picker
2. Click any of the 6 sidebar filter buttons
3. Verify date range is set in calendar (highlighted days)
4. Verify time inputs show 00:00 and 23:59

### To Test Reset Button
1. Set a date range (via filter or manual selection)
2. Click "Reset Date" button
3. Verify all dates and times are cleared
4. Verify calendar returns to neutral state

### To Test Show Results
1. Set a complete selection (dates + times)
2. Click "Show Results" button
3. Verify picker closes and selection is confirmed
4. Try clicking "Show Results" without complete selection
5. Verify picker stays open

## Session Context
These functional fixes were applied after the rectangle allocation fixes to ensure the interactive elements work correctly. The root cause was misalignment between visual labels, internal keys, and switch case values across three separate arrays/collections.
