# Final Compilation Errors Fixed

## Summary
Fixed the last three compilation errors in the tree painter system.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. VercelCleanTreePainter.cs (CS0019)
**Error:** `Operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type 'NodeInfo' and '<null>'`

**Cause:** NodeInfo is a struct, and structs in C# cannot be null.

**Fix:** Changed all null checks from:
```csharp
if (g == null || node == null) return;
```
To:
```csharp
if (g == null || node.Item == null) return;
```

**Applied to 26 files:** All tree painters including BaseTreePainter

### 2. DocumentTreePainter.cs (CS0103)
**Error:** `The name 'CardCornerRadius' does not exist in the current context`

**Status:** Already fixed in previous pass - constant was added to the class.

### 3. BeepTree.Core.cs (CS0246)
**Error:** `The type or namespace name 'TreeItem' could not be found`

**Cause:** Incorrect type name for LastHoveredItem property.

**Fix:** Changed from:
```csharp
internal TreeItem LastHoveredItem => _lastHoveredItem;
```
To:
```csharp
internal SimpleItem LastHoveredItem => _lastHoveredItem;
```

## Files Modified

### BeepTree.Core.cs
- Fixed LastHoveredItem return type from TreeItem to SimpleItem

### All Tree Painters (26 files)
- BaseTreePainter.cs
- ActivityLogTreePainter.cs
- AntDesignTreePainter.cs
- BootstrapTreePainter.cs
- ChakraUITreePainter.cs
- ComponentTreePainter.cs
- DevExpressTreePainter.cs
- DiscordTreePainter.cs
- DocumentTreePainter.cs
- FigmaCardTreePainter.cs
- FileBrowserTreePainter.cs
- FileManagerTreePainter.cs
- Fluent2TreePainter.cs
- InfrastructureTreePainter.cs
- iOS15TreePainter.cs
- MacOSBigSurTreePainter.cs
- Material3TreePainter.cs
- NotionMinimalTreePainter.cs
- PillRailTreePainter.cs
- PortfolioTreePainter.cs
- StandardTreePainter.cs
- StripeDashboardTreePainter.cs
- SyncfusionTreePainter.cs
- TailwindCardTreePainter.cs
- TelerikTreePainter.cs
- VercelCleanTreePainter.cs

## Result

All compilation errors are now resolved. The tree painter system should compile successfully with:
- Correct PaintNode signatures matching ITreePainter interface
- Proper NodeInfo struct null checks (checking node.Item instead)
- Correct type references (SimpleItem instead of TreeItem)
- All required constants defined
