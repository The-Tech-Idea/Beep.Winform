### Phase 3 - Multi-Select Workflow Parity
- [x] Unify apply/cancel semantics between controls
- [x] Batch select-all/clear-all updates to avoid event storms
- [ ] Validate large-list responsiveness and state consistency (manual QA pending)

### Phase 4 - Theme, DPI, RTL, and Property Contracts
- [x] Wire popup-related properties end-to-end
- [x] Apply explicit precedence: property override > token > fallback
- [x] Complete popup/field RTL parity
- [ ] Validate DPI and theme switching behavior (manual QA pending)

### Phase 5 - Architecture Consolidation
- [x] Consolidate `ComboBoxType` mapping in a single registry
- [x] Extract shared popup plumbing to reduce duplication
- [x] Preserve model fields during host normalization
- [ ] Validate type mapping consistency and behavior parity (manual QA pending)

### Automated Verification Completed
- [x] `dotnet build TheTechIdea.Beep.Winform.Controls/TheTechIdea.Beep.Winform.Controls.csproj` passes after each consolidation wave
- [x] Lint checks on modified `ComboBoxes` and `Popup` files show no diagnostics

### Manual QA Matrix Pending
- [ ] Per-variant visual/state matrix (`normal/hover/focus/open/disabled/loading/validation`)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation parity across all popup content variants
- [ ] Multi-select stress pass (`select-all/clear-all/toggle burst`) on large lists
- [ ] DPI pass (`100/125/150/200`) and RTL pass for field + popup alignment
- [x] QA matrix doc created: `docs/plans/combobox-overhaul/manual-qa-matrix.md`

### Manual QA Execution Order
- [ ] Run core field state matrix for all `ComboBoxType` variants
- [ ] Run popup behavior matrix by popup content variant
- [ ] Run row-kind contract matrix (including state rows)
- [ ] Run multi-select stress matrix on large dataset
- [ ] Run property contract matrix and record pass/fail summary
- [x] QA session log template created: `docs/plans/combobox-overhaul/manual-qa-session-log.md`

## DocumentHost Polish Layer (Commercial Parity)

*Goal: close the remaining gap between BeepDocumentHost and DevExpress/Krypton quality.*
*Plans detail: `TheTechIdea.Beep.Winform.Controls/DocumentHost/.plans/`*

### Phase 1 — Design-Time UX Completion (G2, G3, G8)

- [ ] **G2** — Add `DesignerActionPropertyItem` to `DocumentHostActionList` for `TabStyle`, `TabPosition`, `CloseMode`, `ShowAddButton`, `KeyboardShortcutsEnabled`
- [ ] **G2** — Add smart-tag quick actions: "Add Document", "Clear All Documents", "Copy Layout Snapshot"
- [ ] **G3** — Override `CanParent(Control, Type)` in `BeepDocumentHostDesigner` (accept any `Control`)
- [ ] **G3** — Override `OnDragDrop` in `BeepDocumentHostDesigner` → route dropped control to active document area
- [ ] **G8** — Add designer verbs: "Export Layout Snapshot…", "Clear All Documents", "Customize Keyboard Shortcuts…"

### Phase 2 — Drag Orchestration Polish

- [ ] Theme-aware ghost window — replace `Color.FromArgb(48, 54, 70)` with `_currentTheme?.TabActiveBackColor` in `BeepDocumentTabStrip.Mouse.cs`
- [ ] Ghost size matches tab width (~200 px wide, 36 px tall) instead of hardcoded 140×28
- [ ] Escape key cancels drag-to-float (handle in `OnKeyDown` while `_dragFloating || _dragging`)
- [ ] Raise `TabFloatDragStarted` event when `_dragFloating` becomes true → activates `BeepDocumentDockOverlay`
- [ ] Paint 2 px vertical insert-caret at `_dragInsertIndex` in `BeepDocumentTabStrip.Painting.cs`

### Phase 3 — Keyboard Shortcut Completions

- [ ] `Ctrl+Alt+Left` — move active tab to previous split group (`MoveActiveDocumentToAdjacentGroup(-1)`)
- [ ] `Ctrl+Alt+Right` — move active tab to next split group (`MoveActiveDocumentToAdjacentGroup(+1)`)
- [ ] `Ctrl+Shift+W` — close all tabs to the right of the active tab
- [ ] `Ctrl+Shift+M` — maximize / restore active document panel

### Phase 4 — Auto-Hide Flyout Polish

- [ ] Add 28 px themed header panel inside `_ahOverlay` (title label + pin button + close button)
- [ ] Pin button calls `RestoreAutoHideDocument(documentId)`
- [ ] Close button calls `CloseAhOverlay(animate: true)`
- [ ] Apply `_currentTheme?.PanelBackColor` / `PanelForeColor` to header
- [ ] Subscribe to focus-loss (`Leave` event on `_ahOverlay`); auto-collapse after 500 ms debounce

### Phase 5 — Sample Form + Animation

- [ ] Expand `MainFrm_MDI.cs` with `BeepDocumentHost` filling client area + `AttachWindowMenu` + `AutoSaveLayout`
- [ ] Add "Add Document" button, `ActiveDocumentChanged` status strip label, View menu TabStyle cycle
- [ ] Replace linear lerp with ease-in-out cubic `t*t*(3-2*t)` in tab open/close animation
- [ ] Verify indicator-slide easing (currently quadratic ease-out — confirm or fix)

### Phase 6 — Designer Validation (Track B)

- [ ] Properties window shows only categorized groups, no *Misc*
- [ ] Smart-tag inline pickers change designer state immediately
- [ ] Toolbox drag onto host → drops into first document area
- [ ] "Export Layout Snapshot…" verb exports valid JSON
- [ ] Designer reopen restores from `DesignTimeLayoutJson` without crash
- [ ] Delete host → no orphaned child controls remain
