private const int ShadowRadius = 8;
```
Used for shadow blur radius in Tailwind card shadows.

## Files Modified
- TailwindCardTreePainter.cs
- StripeDashboardTreePainter.cs
- PortfolioTreePainter.cs
- MacOSBigSurTreePainter.cs
- iOS15TreePainter.cs
- Fluent2TreePainter.cs

## Result
All compilation errors related to missing constants have been resolved. Each painter now has all the constants it needs for its custom rendering logic.

## Complete Status
✅ All PaintNode signatures fixed (matching ITreePainter)
✅ All NodeInfo null checks fixed (checking node.Item instead)
✅ All type references corrected (SimpleItem instead of TreeItem)
✅ All missing constants defined

**The tree painter system should now compile successfully with zero errors!**
