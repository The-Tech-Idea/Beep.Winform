# MultipleDateTimePicker Issues and Fixes

## Issues Found

### ✅ Issue 1: DrawRoundedRectangle Extension Method (Line 143)
**Problem**: Painter calls `g.DrawRoundedRectangle(pen, bounds, 4)` but no such method exists
**Status**: Actually NOT an error - must be defined elsewhere or as an extension
**Action**: Check if it compiles - if not, add the method

### ✅ Issue 2: Hit Handler Logic
**Problem**: None - hit handler logic looks correct
**Details**:
- Uses `GetDayCellMatrixOrDefault()` ✅ EXISTS
- Uses `owner.GetCurrentProperties()` ✅ EXISTS  
- Toggle selection logic ✅ CORRECT
- Clear button handling ✅ CORRECT

### ❓ Issue 3: Painter Not Painting  
**Potential Problems**:
1. Clear button rect calculation might not match between painter and hit handler
2. DayCellRects might not be properly initialized

## Analysis

### Clear Button Rect Mismatch

**In Painter (line 75)**:
```csharp
PaintClearButton(g, new Rectangle(bounds.X + 16, layout.CalendarGridRect.Bottom + 40, bounds.Width - 32, 32), hoverState, properties);
```
- X: `bounds.X + 16`
- Y: `layout.CalendarGridRect.Bottom + 40`
- Width: `bounds.Width - 32`
- Height: `32`

**In HitHandler (lines 53-58)**:
```csharp
var clearButtonRect = new Rectangle(
    layout.CalendarGridRect.X,                  // ❌ Different from painter!
    layout.CalendarGridRect.Bottom + 40,        // ✅ Same
    layout.CalendarGridRect.Width,              // ❌ Different from painter!
    32                                          // ✅ Same
);
```

**ISSUE**: X and Width don't match!
- Painter uses: `bounds.X + 16` and `bounds.Width - 32`
- HitHandler uses: `layout.CalendarGridRect.X` and `layout.CalendarGridRect.Width`

### Solution

The Clear button should be stored in the layout instead of calculated in both places.

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Add ClearButtonRect to Layout

Add to `DateTimePickerLayout` class:
```csharp
public Rectangle ClearButtonRect { get; set; }
```

### Fix 2: Calculate in Painter's CalculateLayout

In `MultipleDateTimePickerPainter.CalculateLayout()`:
```csharp
// Add after calendar grid calculation
layout.ClearButtonRect = new Rectangle(
    bounds.X + padding, 
    layout.CalendarGridRect.Bottom + 40, 
    bounds.Width - padding * 2, 
    32
);
```

### Fix 3: Use Layout Rect in Painter

In `PaintCalendar()`:
```csharp
// Change from:
PaintClearButton(g, new Rectangle(bounds.X + 16, layout.CalendarGridRect.Bottom + 40, bounds.Width - 32, 32), hoverState, properties);

// To:
PaintClearButton(g, layout.ClearButtonRect, hoverState, properties);
```

### Fix 4: Use Layout Rect in HitHandler

In `MultipleDateTimePickerHitHandler.HitTest()`:
```csharp
// Change from:
var clearButtonRect = new Rectangle(
    layout.CalendarGridRect.X,
    layout.CalendarGridRect.Bottom + 40,
    layout.CalendarGridRect.Width,
    32
);

if (clearButtonRect.Contains(location))
{
    result.IsHit = true;
    result.HitArea = DateTimePickerHitArea.ClearButton;
    result.HitBounds = clearButtonRect;
    return result;
}

// To:
if (!layout.ClearButtonRect.IsEmpty && layout.ClearButtonRect.Contains(location))
{
    result.IsHit = true;
    result.HitArea = DateTimePickerHitArea.ClearButton;
    result.HitBounds = layout.ClearButtonRect;
    return result;
}
```

## Implementation Status

- ❌ ClearButtonRect not added to DateTimePickerLayout
- ❌ ClearButtonRect not calculated in CalculateLayout  
- ❌ Painter not using layout.ClearButtonRect
- ❌ HitHandler not using layout.ClearButtonRect

All 4 fixes needed to resolve the issue.
