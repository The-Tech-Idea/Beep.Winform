## Implementation Rules

1. **One painter at a time** - Complete implementation before moving to next
2. **Distinct visual identity** - Each must look clearly different from others
3. **Match design system** - Follow the conventions of the framework/style
4. **Update this plan** - Mark status after each painter is complete
5. **No batch work** - Individual, focused implementation per painter
6. **No building/testing** - Just implement the code

---

## Notes
- StandardTreePainter already has PaintNode override (with tree lines)
- BaseTreePainter.PaintNode provides default implementation
- Each painter can choose to override PaintNode or override individual methods
- For maximum distinctness, most painters should override PaintNode
