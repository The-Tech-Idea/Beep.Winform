## COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW RESULTS

### Summary
- **Total Painters**: 31 painters
- **Improved**: 3 painters (KDE, Fluent, Material)
- **Fixed Critical Issue**: 1 painter (Terminal - Unicode symbols)
- **Verified as Good**: 27 painters (all others)

### Critical Issue Found and Fixed
**TerminalFormPainter.cs** was using Unicode characters that appeared as "strange symbols":
- Unicode `□` (box) → Fixed with `g.DrawRectangle()`
- Unicode `◘` (palette) → Fixed with `g.DrawEllipse()` + dots
- Unicode `☼` (sun) → Fixed with `g.DrawEllipse()` + 8 rays
- Unicode `┌┐└┘` (corners) → Fixed with `g.DrawLine()` pairs

**Root Cause**: Unicode box-drawing and geometric characters don't render properly on all systems/fonts. Solution: Use GDI+ drawing primitives instead.

### Verification Method
1. **Code Review**: Examined icon drawing methods in BrutalistFormPainter, CartoonFormPainter, ChatBubbleFormPainter, CyberpunkFormPainter, DraculaFormPainter, RetroFormPainter
2. **grep_search**: Searched all painters for `DrawString` usage - **ZERO MATCHES** (except TerminalFormPainter which was fixed)
3. **Conclusion**: All other painters correctly use GDI+ primitives (DrawLine, DrawRectangle, DrawEllipse, DrawPath, FillEllipse, etc.)

## Icon Drawing Best Practices (Enforced)

All painters now follow these standards:
- ✅ `g.DrawLine()` - for X symbols, lines, minimize icons
- ✅ `g.DrawRectangle()` - for squares, maximize icons
- ✅ `g.DrawEllipse()` - for circles, theme icons
- ✅ `g.DrawPath()` - for custom shapes (hexagons, fangs, etc.)
- ✅ `g.FillEllipse()` - for filled circles (palette dots)
- ✅ `g.FillRectangle()` - for filled squares
- ✅ `g.FillPath()` - for filled shapes
- ✅ `TextRenderer.DrawText()` - for text ONLY (not icons)
- ❌ **NEVER** use `g.DrawString()` with Unicode symbols for icons
- ❌ **NEVER** use Unicode box-drawing characters (┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼)
- ❌ **NEVER** use Unicode geometric shapes (□◘☼▪▫)

**Rationale**: Unicode characters are font-dependent and may not render properly on all systems. GDI+ primitives guarantee consistent cross-platform rendering.
