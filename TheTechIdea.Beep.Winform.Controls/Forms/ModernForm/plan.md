# BeepiFormPro Modernization Plan

Goal: Transform `BeepiFormPro` into a modern, stylable window form using multi-painters and BeepStyling, with partial classes and helper managers (layout, hit-test, interaction) similar to BeepTree.

## Objectives
- Use BeepStyling + BeepControlStyle for background/border/caption rendering.
- Support multiple painters (strategy pattern) to swap visual styles at runtime.
- Partial class split: Core, Drawing, Painters, Layout, HitTesting, Interaction, Models.
- LayoutManager: compute caption, footer, sidebars, content, and custom regions.
- HitAreaManager: register/resolve interactive areas and custom regions.
- InteractionManager: hover/press/select handling for regions and caption areas.
- Extensible Region API: add text/drawings anywhere on caption/bottom/side.

## Architecture
- Class: `BeepiFormPro` (partial) with properties:
  - `BeepControlStyle ControlStyle { get; set; }`
  - `IList<IFormPainter> Painters` + `IFormPainter ActivePainter`
  - Managers: `_layout`, `_hits`, `_interact`
  - Regions: `_regions` list of `FormRegion`
- Managers:
  - `BeepiFormProLayoutManager`
  - `BeepiFormProHitAreaManager`
  - `BeepiFormProInteractionManager`
- Painters (initial):
  - `MinimalFormPainter`
  - `MaterialFormPainter`
- Models:
  - `FormRegion` (id, rect, dock, drawing delegate)
  - `HitArea` (name, rect, type, data)
  - `RegionDock` enum (Caption, Bottom, Left, Right, ContentOverlay)

## Milestones
1) Scaffolding: partials, models, managers, painter interfaces, basic render loop
2) Implement Minimal painter (bg + border + caption strip)
3) Implement Material painter variant
4) Region API + sample text region rendering
5) Hit testing + interaction (hover/press/click) over regions and caption
6) Polish: DPI scaling, theme reactivity, window drag via caption

- [Step 20] Updated LayoutManager.Calculate() to use DPI-scaled constants (32px button width, 8px margins, 24px icon)
- [Step 21] Added custom action button region (_customActionButton) with gear icon (âš™) and hover/press effects
- [Step 22] Added CustomActionButtonRect to LayoutManager, positioned between title and system buttons
- [Step 23] Added RegionHover and RegionClick events for extensibility without subclassing
- [Step 24] Created RegionEventArgs class with RegionName, Region, and Bounds properties
- [Step 25] Updated InteractionManager to raise RegionHover event on hover state changes
- [Step 26] Updated OnRegionClicked to raise RegionClick event and handle custom action button
- [Step 27] Added OnCustomActionClicked virtual method with default MessageBox implementation
- [Step 28] Implemented GlassFormPainter with gradient glass effect, semi-transparent background, and dual borders
- [Step 29] Updated Drawing.cs to register and render custom action button region
- [Step 30] Updated constructor to call UpdateDpiScale() during initialization
- [Step 31] **Refactored painters into Painters/ folder structure with individual files**
  - Created IFormPainter.cs interface with comprehensive XML documentation
  - Created MinimalFormPainter.cs (60 lines) with clean minimal design
  - Created MaterialFormPainter.cs (62 lines) with Material Design 3 style
  - Created GlassFormPainter.cs (94 lines) with glass effect and transparency
  - Created Painters/Readme.md (312 lines) with complete documentation
  - Updated core files with using statements for new Painters namespace
  - Maintained backward compatibility with global using aliases
- [Step 32] **Added backdrop effects support (BeepiFormPro.Backdrop.cs)**
  - Added BackdropType property: None, Blur, Acrylic, Mica, Tabbed, Transient
  - Added EnableAcrylicForGlass property for automatic Acrylic with Glass style
  - Added EnableMicaBackdrop property for Windows 11 Mica effect
  - Implemented Windows API interop: SetWindowCompositionAttribute, DwmSetWindowAttribute
  - Added OnHandleCreated override to apply backdrop effects when window handle is created
  - Supports modern Windows backdrop effects: Blur-behind, Acrylic, Mica, System backdrops
  - Full XML documentation for all methods and properties
  - Design-time safe with IsHandleCreated checks
- [Step 33] **Added Theme and Style buttons with proper event handling**
  - Added ShowThemeButton property (bool, default false) - shows palette icon (ðŸŽ¨)
  - Added ShowStyleButton property (bool, default false) - shows layout icon (â—§)
  - Added ThemeButtonClicked event - raised when theme button is clicked
  - Added StyleButtonClicked event - raised when style button is clicked
  - Added ShowCaptionBar property (bool, default true) - controls caption bar visibility
  - Added CaptionHeight property (int, default 32) - controls caption bar height
  - Updated BeepiFormProLayoutManager to calculate ThemeButtonRect and StyleButtonRect
  - Theme/Style buttons positioned left of system buttons (minimize/maximize/close)
  - Custom action button (âš™) shown only when theme/style buttons are hidden
  - All buttons have hover/press visual feedback using BeepStyling colors
  - Proper button ordering: Icon | Title | [Theme] [Style] | [CustomAction] | Min | Max | Close
- [Step 34] **Fixed DisplayRectangle to exclude caption bar area**
  - Overridden DisplayRectangle property to reduce available area by caption height
  - User controls added to form now start below caption bar (no overlap)
  - Works with all custom FormStyles: Modern, Minimal, Material, Fluent, MacOS
  - Classic FormStyle uses standard Windows caption (no adjustment needed)
  - Matches BeepiForm behavior - caption area reserved for system use
