## ⭐ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Painter Pattern Architecture** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ ISwitchPainter interface with 7 methods
- ✅ Factory maps ALL 56+ BeepControlStyle values
- ✅ 4 core painters implemented
- ✅ ALL use `BackgroundPainterFactory` (consistent!)

- ✅ ALL use `StyledImagePainter` (consistent!)

### 2. **Icon Library Integration** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ `OnIconName`/`OffIconName` properties
- ✅ Uses `SvgsUI` class from `TheTechIdea.Beep.Icons`
- ✅ Reflection-based icon resolution
- ✅ Convenience methods:
  - `UseCheckmarkIcons()` → check/close

  - `UseLightIcons()` → lightbulb/lightbulb_outline

### 3. **Animation System** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Smooth 60 FPS animation
- ✅ Ease-out cubic easing function
- ✅ Configurable duration per painter:
  - iOS: 300ms (spring-like)
  - Material3: 200ms (standard)
  - Fluent2: 200ms (standard)
  - Minimal: 150ms (snappy)
- ✅ Interpolated thumb position
- ✅ Animation progress tracking (0.0 → 1.0)

### 4. **Hit Area System** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Uses BaseControl hit area system!
- ✅ Track hit area → click anywhere on track to toggle
- ✅ Thumb hit area → drag support
- ✅ On label hit area → click to set On
- ✅ Off label hit area → click to set Off
- ✅ Automatic hover detection (BaseControl!)
- ✅ Automatic press detection (BaseControl!)

### 5. **Drag to Toggle** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Drag thumb left/right (horizontal)
- ✅ Drag thumb up/down (vertical)
- ✅ Snap to nearest state on release
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag
- ✅ `DragToToggleEnabled` property to disable

### 6. **Keyboard Accessibility** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Space key toggles
- ✅ Enter key toggles
- ✅ Focus indication
- ✅ Disabled state support

### 7. **State Management** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**SwitchState Enum** (11 states):
- Off: Normal, Hover, Pressed, Disabled, Focused
- On: Normal, Hover, Pressed, Disabled, Focused
- Transitioning (during animation)

**Automatic state detection**:
- Uses `IsPressed`, `IsHovered`, `Focused` from BaseControl
- Combines with Checked state
- Passes to painters for state-aware rendering

### 8. **Theme Integration** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ `ApplyTheme()` override
- ✅ Reinitializes painter on theme change
- ✅ Automatic redraw
- ✅ Uses `_currentTheme` from BaseControl

## 🎨 Painter System Details

### Factory Mapping (56+ Styles):
```csharp
iOS15, Material3, Fluent2, AntDesign, MaterialYou, Windows11Mica, MacOSBigSur,
ChakraUI, TailwindCard, NotionMinimal, VercelClean, StripeDashboard, DarkGlow,
DiscordStyle, GradientModern, GlassAcrylic, Neumorphism, Bootstrap, FigmaCard,
PillRail, Apple, Fluent, Material, WebFramework, Effect, Metro, Office, Gnome,

### Painter Architecture:
Each painter implements:
- `CalculateLayout()` → Metrics calculation
- `PaintTrack()` → Uses BackgroundPainterFactory
- `PaintThumb()` → Circular knob
- `PaintLabels()` → On/Off text
- `GetAnimationDuration()` → Style-specific timing
- `GetTrackSizeRatio()` → Width:height ratio
- `GetThumbSizeRatio()` → Thumb size % of track

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic iOS-Style Switch:
```csharp
var switch1 = new BeepSwitch
{
    ControlStyle = BeepControlStyle.iOS15,
    OnLabel = "Enable",
    OffLabel = "Disable",
    Checked = true,
    UseThemeColors = true
};
switch1.CheckedChanged += (s, e) => {
  //  Console.WriteLine($"Switch is now: {switch1.Checked}");
};
```

### Material 3 with Icons:
```csharp
var powerSwitch = new BeepSwitch
{
    ControlStyle = BeepControlStyle.Material3,
    OnLabel = "Power On",
    OffLabel = "Power Off",
    DragToToggleEnabled = true
};
powerSwitch.UsePowerIcons();  // Sets OnIconName/OffIconName
```

### Vertical Minimal Switch:
```csharp
var verticalSwitch = new BeepSwitch
{
    Orientation = SwitchOrientation.Vertical,
    ControlStyle = BeepControlStyle.Minimal,
    Width = 50,
    Height = 120
};
```

### With Custom Icons:
```csharp
var customSwitch = new BeepSwitch
{
    OnIconName = "lightbulb",      // From SvgsUI library!
    OffIconName = "lightbulb_outline",
    ControlStyle = BeepControlStyle.Fluent2
};
```

3. Numbered step support

**From Order Tracking image:**
1. Add checkmark animation on toggle
2. Timeline layout mode
3. Status text support
