_theme.TreeNodeSelectedBackColor  // Selected node background
_theme.TreeNodeSelectedForeColor  // Selected node text
_theme.TreeNodeHoverBackColor     // Hovered node background
_theme.TreeNodeHoverForeColor     // Hovered node text
_theme.AccentColor                // Highlights, chevrons, focus
_theme.BorderColor                // Lines, separators, borders
```

### ‚ùå DO NOT USE (Generic Control Colors)
```csharp
_theme.BackColor              // ‚ùå Use TreeBackColor
_theme.ForeColor              // ‚ùå Use TreeForeColor

## Implementation Checklist for Each Painter

- [x] Inherit from `BaseTreePainter`
- [x] Override `PaintNodeBackground()` with tree theme colors
- [x] Override `PaintToggle()` with tree theme colors
- [x] Override `PaintIcon()` with tree theme colors
- [x] Override `PaintText()` with tree theme colors
- [x] Override `Paint()` with TreeBackColor
- [x] Add custom helper methods (status pills, badges, etc.)
- [x] Use `GetPreferredRowHeight()` for spacing
- [x] Document all features in XML comments

---

## Next Steps

1. **Continue creating painters** - Focus on modern framework styles next
2. **Add TreeStyle property to BeepTree.cs** - Wire up painter factory
3. **Update DrawContent()** - Use painter instead of direct rendering
4. **Create painter template** - Speed up remaining 26 painters
5. **Test with themes** - Verify all colors work across light/dark themes

---

## Notes

- All completed painters use correct tree-specific theme colors
- Each painter has unique visual features matching reference styles
- Painters are self-contained and don't modify tree state
- Performance optimized with graphics caching where applicable
- Reference document: `THEME_COLOR_MAPPINGS.md`
- Architecture guide: `TREESTYLE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`

---

## Estimated Time

- **Completed**: 5 painters (~ 5 hours)
- **Remaining**: 26 painters (~ 26 hours)
- **Integration**: BeepTree.cs updates (~ 2 hours)
- **Testing**: Theme verification (~ 2 hours)
- **Total**: ~35 hours project

**Current Progress**: 16.1% (5/31)

## Important Notes

- **Drag-and-Drop Removed**: DragDropTreePainter was removed because drag-and-drop functionality belongs in the BeepTree control itself, not as a visual painter style. Painters only control visual appearance, not interaction behavior.
