### BeepSocialWidget.cs
- Updated to use `SocialProfileCardPainter` instead of `ProfileCardPainter` to avoid naming conflicts with the Cards system

## Key Features Maintained

- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status dots
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to available space

### TeamMembersPainter

### MessageCardPainter

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear sender, content, timestamp structure
- **Accent Styling**: Subtle border with theme accent color

## Technical Details

### Common Features Across All Painters
- Inherit from `WidgetPainterBase`
- Implement `IWidgetPainter` interface
- Support for theme colors and accent colors
- Consistent padding and layout patterns
- Soft shadows and rounded corners where appropriate

### Rendering Capabilities
- Custom drawing with Graphics API
- Font rendering with proper disposal
- Color management with alpha blending
- Path-based shapes for rounded elements

## Naming Resolution
- **Issue**: Original `ProfileCardPainter` name conflicted with existing Cards system ProfileCardPainter
- **Solution**: Renamed to `SocialProfileCardPainter` to clearly distinguish its purpose for social widgets
- **Impact**: BeepSocialWidget updated to use the new class name, maintaining full functionality

## Compilation Status
? All individual painter files compile successfully  
? BeepSocialWidget can access all painters without issues  
? No breaking changes to existing functionality  
? No naming conflicts with existing Cards system  

## Next Steps
The placeholder implementations (ActivityStream, UserList, ChatWidget, CommentThread, SocialFeed, UserStats) can be enhanced with full functionality as needed. Each now has its own dedicated file making development and maintenance easier
